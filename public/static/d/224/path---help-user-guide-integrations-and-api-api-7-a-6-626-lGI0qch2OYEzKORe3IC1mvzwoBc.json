{"data":{"Article":{"html":"<h2>API Authentication</h2>\n<p>All the API calls support authentication with an API key. Redash has two types\nof API keys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User API Key: has the same permissions as the user who owns it. Can be found on a user profile page.</li>\n<li>Query API Key: has access only to the query and its results. Can be found on the query page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever possible we recommend using a Query API key.</p>\n<h2>API Usage Examples</h2>\n<p>Below you can find a few example scripts that use our API for various tasks:</p>\n<h3>Export All Your Queries as Files</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/arikfr/598590356c4da18be976\">https://gist.github.com/arikfr/598590356c4da18be976</a></p>\n<p>Given an API key, it will export all the account queries as simple files on\nyour file system. Can be useful for backups or to sync a git repository.</p>\n<h3>Poll for Fresh Query Results (including parameters)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/arikfr/e3e434d8cfd7f331d499ccf351abbff9\">https://gist.github.com/arikfr/e3e434d8cfd7f331d499ccf351abbff9</a></p>\n<p>This example uses the refresh API to make Redash refresh a query to make sure\nyou get fresh results and then poll the API until a result is ready. Can be\nused for queries with or without parameters.</p>","frontmatter":{"permalink":null,"title":"API","description":null,"keywords":null,"parent_category":"user-guide","category":"integrations-and-api","toc":null,"layout":null,"hide_topics":null},"parent":{"__typename":"File","relativePath":"kb/user-guide/integrations-and-api/api.md"}},"Parent":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Integrations and API"}},"Section":{"name":"User Guide"}},"pageContext":{"category":"integrations-and-api","parent_category":"user-guide","slug":"api"}}
