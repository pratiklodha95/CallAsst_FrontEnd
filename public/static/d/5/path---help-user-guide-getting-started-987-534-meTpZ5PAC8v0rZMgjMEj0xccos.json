Add A Data Source</h2>\n<p>The first thing you'll want to do is connect a data source (<a href=\"%7B%25%20link%20_kb/data-sources/setup/supported-data-sources.md%20%25%7D\">see supported data sources</a>). You can open the Data Sources management page by clicking the Settings icon:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/docs/settings_icon.png\"></p>\n<p>{% callout %}\nIf you‚Äôre using the Hosted Redash service and your data source is behind a firewall, you need to <strong>allow access from the IP address <code>52.71.84.157</code></strong> in your database firewall/Security Groups.\n{% endcallout %}</p>\n<p>{% callout %}\nWe recommend using a user with <strong>read-only permissions</strong>, if possible.\n{% endcallout %}</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/docs/gitbook/add-data-source.gif\"></p>\n<h2>2. Write A Query</h2>\n<p>Once you've connected a data source, it's time to write a query: <strong>click on \"Create\" in the navigation bar, and then choose \"Query\"</strong>. See the <a href=\"%7B%25%20link%20_kb/user-guide/querying/writing-queries.md%20%25%7D\">‚ÄúWriting Queries‚Äù page</a> for detailed instructions on how to write queries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/docs/gifs/queries/add_new_query.gif\"></p>\n<h2>3. Add Visualizations</h2>\n<p>By default, your query results (data) will appear in a simple table. Visualizations are much better to help you digest complex information, so let's visualize your data. Redash supports <a href=\"%7B%25%20link%20_kb/user-guide/visualizations/visualization-types.md%20%25%7D\">multiple types of\nvisualizations</a> so you should find one that suits your needs.</p>\n<p>Click the ‚ÄúNew Visualization‚Äù button just above the results to select the perfect visualization for your needs. You can view more detailed instructions <a href=\"%7B%25%20link%20_kb/user-guide/visualizations/visualizations-how-to.md%20%25%7D\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/docs/gifs/visualization/new_viz.gif\"></p>\n<h2>4. Create A Dashboard</h2>\n<p>You can combine visualizations and text into thematic &#x26; powerful dashboards. Add a new dashboard by clicking on \"Create\" in the navigation bar, and then choose \"Dashboard\". Dashboards are visible for your team members or they can be shared publicly.
